# mypypkg

A starter template for my python projects and packages

## Setup

The setup.py file is ported from [kennethreitz](https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py)

## Docs

I use mkdocs and the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for documentation. 
Check the [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/blob/master/mkdocs.yml) for config options.
